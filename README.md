## SIMON JONES submission - Tipalti React Starter Template
This is a simple tabulated dislay of fetched data from an API, as part of the interview process for Tipalti.
It was built off of a simplified React starter template configured using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience.
Instead of being forked, this repository was cloned using SSH from a provided template https://github.com/ruairidhflint/react-ts-starter, and was pushed to a new repo on @SooMash's GitHub by pointing it to the the repo's URL. 

### Tech stack
Main technologies in use are
- NPM
- Vite
- React
- TypeScript
- MaterialUI
- Prettier

### To run locally
- Clone repo locally with HTTPS or SSH method
- From the root folder, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
- Run in terminal: `npm run dev`
- Open localhost port as indicated


### Noteworthy features: user experience as primary focus
- Fully responsive from mobile to desktop screen widths
- Loading state, error state & user friendly error toaster

### Noteworthy features: contributing developers as primary focus
- Features were contributed to a GIT repository to mimic a basic GitFlow strategy (feature branch -> feature PR -> develop branch -> release PR -> production branch (main)). PS - "develop branch" was excluded for sake of time, instead PR-ing directly into master branch
- All releases to 'production' were tagged with semantic versioning
- Re-usable components adhered to in modern React standards, very little duplicated code.
- Prettier formatting implemented for readibilty & consistent code structure.
